# AR mobile application for hybrid gifting
Gifting has essential meaning from both social and economic perspectives. As a social process, it helps to build bonds between people.
Hybrid gifts are the type of gifting that combine physical content with digital content. They are composed of a physical gift with digital wrapping or vice versa. 

The research is going to explore a novel form of hybrid gift which allows givers to create customized AR experiences for receivers. We call the new implementation as “game-like” AR technology in hybrid gift. It should enhance the user experience and engagement of hybrid gifts, as well as creating hybrid gifts that are valued by receivers.

## Description

It is a AR moblie application. The users are able to interact with the AR content through physical objects. This application allows users to login as either "Giver" or "Receiver". Depending on the user's status, the corresponding page shows up and provides different features to the user. 

There are four pages in the application.
* 1 - Home Page
* 2 - Login Page
* 3 - Giver Page
* 4 - Receiver Page

## Tools
There are three tools used in this project for application development.

* Unity 3D
  * It is a mature game development tool, with a strong community, AR support, and a rich resource library. It allows developers to switch and build for different platforms, such as Android, IOS, PC, etc. The plugins and assets in the Unity Asset Store can also be used across different platform. Unity also has utility as a medium which connects the database, application and AR engine together. It’s easy to use, and it is capable of complex interaction building. 

* Vuforia
  * Vuforia can be exported to both Android and IOS platforms. It’s simple to use and offers multiple styles of tracker for the object, for example a cylinder. There are three bottles in the box, which are a perfect candidate for use of the cylinder tracker.

* Firebase
  * The accessibility of the AR application for the receivers is essential. Firebase is simple to use and easy to manage. It provides a satisfactory solution for data storage and transmission between different platforms. It also has strong features such as Firestore database and Cloud storage. It’s stable and has scalability.
